With more and more of the world's leading retailers and banks already using Bitcoin, now is the time to invest. 

When it comes to future profits, the sky really is the limit! 

**Investor profits to date: **

If you had purchased $500 worth of Bitcoins at the end of 2011, you would have made a profit of $23,500 by the end of 2015\. That's a 1,175% return per annum. 

However, if you had sold your Bitcoins during the highly volatile period of 2013/14 you would have made over $120,000 from your $500 investment! 

A return of 8,000% a year. 

Not bad for 5 minutes' work. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adcf65f5-568e-420a-85b0-ba6692a52d13.jpg)
